# Requirements

## Environment
* Where the tests should run? <!-- Which interface is being tested. It can be a prototype, deployed version, a legacy interface, etc. e.g.: pre-2.0 project version -->
* Preparation: <!-- How should the interface be prepared. e.g: Create a user for the participant and start the test on the main page of the website. Reset the environment for each test. -->
* Instructions to get this interface: <!-- Provide some instructions to install/ get the program which is being tested for facilitators to configure their environment. Reset the environment for each test. -->

## User profile
Describe the target users you are looking for the test and how many users. You'll need the same amount of participants for each profile. e.g.: A user that has already used other projects similar to Houdini.

# Test design
## Tasks
A list of tasks that the participant has to perform. e.g.:

* Change profile information.
* Discover the project features.

## Scenarios
A list of scenarios for the participant to perform the tasks. They should put the partticipant in a context and not give specific hints about what you want the participant to do. e.g.:

1. You received an e-mail asking to update your personal information because your profile picture is outdated. Please, change your profile picture to a newer one. **Expected behavior: Click on the user icon, choose "Profile Settings" in the dropdown menu and click "Edit"**
2. When you were navigating through the application, you realized how awesome it is and you want to discover what else you can do with it. Can you find out what else the application does? **Expected behavior: Click on "Features" navbar item**

## Results

### Task 1

5 of 7 participants succeeded.

The participants who weren't able to complete the task complained about not having a label objectively saying "Help" instead of the "?" icon.

#### What went well?
Participants intuitively clicked on the "?" icon to find the help documentation.

#### What were the challenges?
Some participants didn't understand how to create a new blog post inside a folder, they first created the post and then edited the folder to include the post inside of it. They said they were looking for a select input to choose where the blog post should be placed instead of a folder icon.
